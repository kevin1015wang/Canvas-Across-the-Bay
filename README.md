This is the repository for a little side project that showcases the art in public transit stations across the Bay Area. I was inspired to build this after seeing the winner of the 2024 MTA Open Data Challenge, [Art Off the Rails](https://artworkmta.pages.dev/) by [Stephanie Dang](https://www.stephanie-dang.com/). Most of the design, functionality, and ideas were from Art Off the Rails. Highly recommend checking it out! I wanted to see something similar for the Bay Area, hence “Canvas Across the Bay”.

> The Bay Area's transit hubs can often feel like sensory overload—an orchestra of sounds, a flurry of movement, and the occasional unexpected smell. Yet, amidst this bustling daily rhythm that connects millions across the region, there are moments of hidden artistry waiting to be discovered. From BART stations to Muni platforms, public art transforms our shared spaces into galleries on the go. These installations often go unnoticed as we rush by. How many of these hidden treasures have you encountered in your commutes?

## Art Data

Information on art located in BART stations were sourced from [BART Art Collection Inventory](https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/inventory%20for%20posting.pdf) PDF on bart.gov. 

Information on art located in the MUNI Central Subway were sourced from the [SF Arts Commission’s article](https://sfartscommission.org/experience-art/projects/central-subway-public-art-program) on the central subway.

## Images

Images of the art were sourced from a combination of Google Street View, links from the BART Art Collection Inventory, the SF Arts Commission, and Google Images. I’ll link specific citations to image sources in the near future. 

In the meantime, sources for all images are in captions below pictures after clicking on a piece of art. In addition, clicking on an image on the art details page opens the original page where the image was found.

## One final note…

This is still a huge work in progress from my winter break. More will be added in the coming days! I’ll also make it open source in the coming weeks!

Hopefully, the project helped you discover art that you might’ve missed in your commute!
