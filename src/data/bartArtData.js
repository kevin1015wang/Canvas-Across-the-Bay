        description: `When creating an art installation in a highly trafficked public space, duration matters. While some artworks are intended to celebrate the ephemeral and the fleeting, BART often looks for the permanent and the durable when adding another mural to its portfolio. Given this constraint, Bay Area artists Daniel Galvez and Jos Sances set out to create a mural that would stand the test of time and speak to its community for years to come. Galvez primarily works with paint. Sances is the “high-tech guy,” said Galvez, his longtime friend and collaborator. It was up to Sances to take Galvez’s original oil painting and create something monumental – and long-lasting.`,

Through his schooling, he found inspiration from photorealism and “Los Tres Grandes” (José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Diego Rivera). He worked on the murals People's History of Telegraph Avenue (1976) and Winds of Change (1977), in Berkeley, and completed his first mural Viva la Raza (1977), also in Berkeley, and then Oakland’s Portrait (1981) in Oakland.\n \nJos Sances has made his living as a printmaker and muralist in the San Francisco Bay Area. While founding Alliance Graphics and co-founding Mission Gráfica at San Francisco’s Mission Cultural Center, he maintained a steady output of politically engaged art. The Library of Congress has acquired 495 serigraphs representing an overview of his decades of printmaking. Sances’ work has been exhibited in venues nationally including New York’s Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.`,

This is an interesting piece, titled 'Home' (2006), considering the rough and transient nature of much of this street corners population.  Perhaps the artists intention was to invoke the idea of home, of a settled life lived in many colors, and present this to a largely transient population.  Perhaps as a way of presenting an image of security and peace into a gray, survival minded, and suffering way of life.`,

The human mind envisions a departure and destination with points along the way. This conscious thought is depicted literally – expressing it visually by combining abstract shapes, symbols, signs and images discovered on subway, rail, air and space travel maps and along traveled paths and trails found in nature.

He is best known for his large scale concrete murals and public works of art from the 1960s and 1970s. His work is often of an abstract or stylised nature with its roots in the traditions of craft and "buildability". His use of heavily modelled surfaces created a distinctive language for his predominantly concrete and glass reinforced concrete (GRC) sculptures. After long years of neglect, many of William Mitchell's remaining works in the United Kingdom are now being recognised for their artistic merit and contemporary historic value, and have been granted protective, listed status.`,

Art and science both encourage – if not demand – keen observation of the natural world. Artists and scientists alike use empirical methods in their research, to test hypotheses and, ultimately, to produce results. That these results often get swathed in disparate interpretations, depending on varied artistic or scientific contexts and on the perceived boundaries of institutional settings, such as an art museum, an educational science centre, or an engineering facility, does not undermine the validity of the observations. To quite the contrary, Kahn’s projects exemplify contemporary tendencies to defy institutional and disciplinary categories, to invite public participation, and to integrate scientific and artistic aims. His is an aesthetic of turbulence.`,
