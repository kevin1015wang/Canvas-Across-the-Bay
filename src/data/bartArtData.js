        description: `The metal panel, which was installed two weeks ago in front of De Lauer's news stand on Broadway, is called "Their Eyes Were Watching God," from the Zora Neale Hurston novel. It features a central area adorned with eyes glancing expectantly in different directions, surrounded by a representation of the Oakland hills. Bates said: "It's supposed to suggest that something is about to happen, something is about to be born, and you never know what you're going to get."`,

        description: `When creating an art installation in a highly trafficked public space, duration matters. While some artworks are intended to celebrate the ephemeral and the fleeting, BART often looks for the permanent and the durable when adding another mural to its portfolio. Given this constraint, Bay Area artists Daniel Galvez and Jos Sances set out to create a mural that would stand the test of time and speak to its community for years to come. Galvez primarily works with paint. Sances is the “high-tech guy,” said Galvez, his longtime friend and collaborator. It was up to Sances to take Galvez’s original oil painting and create something monumental – and long-lasting.`,

        artistStory: `Daniel Galvez (born 1953) is an artist, muralist, and painter currently living in Oakland. He was born in Calexico and raised in Sacramento. Through his schooling, he found inspiration from photorealism and “Los Tres Grandes” (José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Diego Rivera). He worked on the murals People's History of Telegraph Avenue (1976) and Winds of Change (1977), in Berkeley, and completed his first mural Viva la Raza (1977), also in Berkeley, and then Oakland’s Portrait (1981) in Oakland.\n \nJos Sances has made his living as a printmaker and muralist in the San Francisco Bay Area. While founding Alliance Graphics and co-founding Mission Gráfica at San Francisco’s Mission Cultural Center, he maintained a steady output of politically engaged art. The Library of Congress has acquired 495 serigraphs representing an overview of his decades of printmaking. Sances’ work has been exhibited in venues nationally including New York’s Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.`,

The disk in the peak panel seems cut out of plexiglass, or else a very good interior cut in glass, as it doesn't appear to have a score leading to the outside edge and  a colored disk floats in its center. This is an interesting piece, titled 'Home' (2006), considering the rough and transient nature of much of this street corners population.  Perhaps the artists intention was to invoke the idea of home, of a settled life lived in many colors, and present this to a largely transient population.  Perhaps as a way of presenting an image of security and peace into a gray, survival minded, and suffering way of life.`,

In the two years since it was unveiled, the piece has never been vandalized. Those who worked on it still stop by to show it off to friends, said Vieira. "The kids are really proud of it," she said. "It's a permanent, public piece of work that will have lasting impact. And it was really fun to make." The project, she said, brightens up one of the busiest and highest-profile spots in the neighborhood. "It's a constant reminder of the positive things youth in this neighborhood are doing. They're not just all hoodlums," she said. "A lot of good has come from this - you don't realize how much impact something like this has, but it really can make a difference."`,
