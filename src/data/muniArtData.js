        description: "Yangge: Dance of the Bride and Yangge: Dance of the New Year, are inspired by the Yangge (Rice Sprout Song), a popular folk dance from the northern provinces of China, which typically involves groups of people dancing in a variety of costumes to celebrate happy occasions. Capturing the lively spirit of the Dance of the Bride, Hou features characters from a Manchu wedding celebration: a bride in a sedan chair, musicians, stilt walkers, and fan dancers. Bringing further playfulness and whimsy to the composition are a kitten, birds, butterflies, and plants adorning the artwork’s border. Capturing the celebratory spirit of the Dance of the New Year, Hou features characters from the 16th century Chinese novel “Journey to the West”: the Tang Monk, the Sand Monk, the Pig, and the Monkey King. Also portrayed are the dragon and lion dances, a stilt dancer with firecrackers, a Manchu shaman holding a peace drum, and other popular folk figures. The artwork on the upper mezzanine landing is approximately 16 feet high by 36 feet wide, the artwork at the ticketing hall is approximately 30 feet high by 35 feet wide.",

He works exclusively within site-specific and interactive contexts that rely on viewer participation to emphasize themes and ideas unique to each project. Using a variety of materials and strategies including light, sound, video and mechanics, these installations engage viewers in ways that address their orientations towards a site and serve as instruments for perception into what makes each site, and each viewer, a unique point of view.`,

This site-specific glass artwork layers a precise topographic map of San Francisco with painted circles that reference Bay Area commute pattern densities. The commuter activates the artwork as they enter the subway station and descend underground, creating a real-time layering of abstraction (shapes and lines) and its source materials (commuters and topography). The title of the artwork, Convergence: Commute Patterns, refers to a convergence as a place where ocean currents or airflows meet, marked by an upwelling of air or a downwelling of water. Commuter movement can feel similar to the rising and falling tides of an ocean or bay as people enter and depart a city each day.",

In 2000, I began to explore a new series of stainless steel kinetic sculpture that has served as a catalyst to augment these themes. The kinetic work interacts with nature and allows the viewer to become engaged with the sculpture. The sculpture responds to the environment and serves to heighten the viewers' awareness of their natural surroundings. They are self-contained systems that are wind driven and provide the viewer with an infinite number of movements that range from tranquil to frenetic as the weather patterns change.`,
